This project addresses another businees problem In this context, I see myself as a data analyst employed at a news financial service company. The task involves visualizing data to help readers comprehend how countries have historically performed in Financial-Consuming.

**To resolve this business problem, I followed several steps:**

1. Cleaning data in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python.
3. Utilizing the KNN algorithm to predict the missing values.
4. Importing the output data to Power BI.
5. Writing DAX formulas to extract specific measures.
6. Building our final dashboard.
